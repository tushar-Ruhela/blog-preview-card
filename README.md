## My process
first  i have create  my project compeletly with the help of html and css 
-> first i am create html file
-> second i will create css file 
-> after designing make page responsive
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned
I am learned  new attributtes and property
like box shadow property, transform,transition property and
position.

and i learned that the svg image is complicated to place directly,
because these image can not modify through css, without giving this image into a div
give only the file path of this svg image.
<div class="card-image">
 <img src="./assets/images/illustration-article.svg" >
    </div>

.blog-card:hover{
    box-shadow: 10px 10px hsl(0, 0%, 7%);
    transform: translate(-10px, -10px);
